# Calculation of Tectonic Subsidence due to Crustal Stretching

## Introduction

This document outlines the derivation for calculating tectonic subsidence resulting from crustal stretching, based on isostatic equilibrium principles. The derivation takes into account the densities and thicknesses of the crust, mantle, asthenosphere, and the density of water.

## Assumptions and Definitions

- \(\rho_c\): Density of the crust.
- \(\rho_m\): Density of the mantle.
- \(\rho_a\): Density of the asthenosphere.
- \(\rho_w\): Density of water.
- \(L_c\): Initial thickness of the crust.
- \(L\): Total thickness of the lithosphere (crust + lithospheric mantle).
- \(B\): Stretching factor.
- \(s\): Subsidence.

## Derivation

### Initial State (Isostatic Equilibrium)

Initially, the isostatic balance is given by:

\[
\rho_c L_c + \rho_m (L - L_c)
\]

### Stretched State

After stretching, the crust is thinned to \(L_c/B\), and the new state of isostatic balance is:

\[
(\rho_w - \rho_a) s + \rho_c \frac{L_c}{B} + \rho_m \left(L - \frac{L_c}{B}\right)
\]

### Equating Initial and Stretched States

Equating the initial and stretched states gives:

\[
\rho_c L_c + \rho_m L - \rho_m L_c = (\rho_w - \rho_a) s + \rho_c \frac{L_c}{B} + \rho_m L - \rho_m \frac{L_c}{B}
\]

Simplifying and solving for \(s\):

\[
(\rho_c - \rho_m) L_c = (\rho_w - \rho_a) s + (\rho_c - \rho_m) \frac{L_c}{B}
\]

\[
s = \frac{(\rho_c - \rho_m) L_c \left(1 - \frac{1}{B}\right)}{\rho_w - \rho_a}
\]

Thus, the equation for subsidence \(s\) considering only the crustal stretching is:

\[
s = \frac{(\rho_c - \rho_m) L_c \left(1 - \frac{1}{B}\right)}{\rho_w - \rho_a}
\]

This equation provides the subsidence \(s\) in terms of the given parameters, demonstrating how crustal stretching affects tectonic subsidence in an isostatic equilibrium context.

## Conclusion

This derivation outlines the calculation steps and assumptions used to derive the equation for tectonic subsidence due to crustal stretching. It serves as a basis for understanding the geological processes involved in crustal deformation and its impact on regional tectonics.
